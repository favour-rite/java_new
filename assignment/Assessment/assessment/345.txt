Prompt the user for another number and store it in a variable called "b".
Use the conditional operator to evaluate if "a" is positive and display "A is positive" or "A is not positive" based on that evaluation.
Use the conditional operator to check if "b" is positive and display "B is positive" or "B is not positive" based on that evaluation.
Finally, use the conditional operator to determine if both numbers are positive and display "Both are positive" or "Both are not positive" accordingly.
